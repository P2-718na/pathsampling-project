    abstract = "{ Almost everyone can ride a bicycle, yet apparently no one knows how they do it. I believe that the apparent simplicity and ease of the trick conceals much unrecognized subtlety, and I have spent some time and effort trying to discover the reasons for the bicycle’s stability. Published theory on the topic is sketchy and presented mainly without experimental verification. In my investigations I hoped to identify the stabilizing features of normal bicycles by constructing abnormal ones lacking selected features (see figure 1). The failure of early unridable bicycles led me to a careful consideration of steering geometry, from which—with the aid of computer calculations—I designed and constructed an inherently unstable bicycle.}",

    abstract = {A new discretization method for the calculation of a sampled-data representation of a nonlinear continuous-time system is proposed. It is based upon the well-known Taylor method and the zero-order hold (ZOH) assumption. The mathematical structure of the new discretization scheme is analyzed and characterized as being particularly useful in establishing concrete connections between numerical properties and system-theoretic properties. In particular, the effect of the Taylor discretization procedure on key properties of nonlinear systems, such as equilibrium properties and asymptotic stability, is examined. Within a control context, numerical aspects of Taylor discretization are also discussed, and ‘hybrid’ discretization schemes, that result from a combination of the ‘scaling and squaring’ technique with the Taylor method, are also proposed, especially under conditions of very low sampling rates. Practical issues associated with the selection of the method’s parameters to meet CPU time and accuracy requirements, are examined as well. Finally, the performance of the proposed discretization procedure is evaluated in a chemical reactor example, that exhibits nonlinear behavior and is subject to various sampling rates.}
